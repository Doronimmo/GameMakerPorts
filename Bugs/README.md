## Notes

# Bugs

## GM 2.3 is quite unstable
If the data.win/game.unx is GM2.3, it is less likely to work without patching!

## Missing sound with .ogg files 

Currently, some GameMaker ports with .ogg files (which are use for sound and background music)

**Fix:**
Create a /assets folder with a .gitkeep in the root of your game directory

Add in the following lines into the .sh Script:

	# Check for .ogg files and move to APK
    	if [ -n "$(ls ./gamedata/*.ogg 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
        mkdir -p ./assets
        mv ./gamedata/*.ogg ./assets/
        echo "Moved .ogg files to ./assets/"

        zip -r -0 ./game.apk ./assets/
        echo "Zipped contents to ./game.apk"

        rm -rf ./assets
        echo "Deleted assets directory"
    else
        echo "No .ogg files found"
    fi

## Game has both mouse and keyboard input and controller inputs concurrently active

Open your game in windows and see if there are in-game options to have controller only OR keyboard and mouse input only.
Select the option that you would like i.e contoller and look for an options.ini or save.ini file generated by the game.
Copy over that folder into game/gamedata folder
